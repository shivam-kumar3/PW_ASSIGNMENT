    "For example, let's consider the heights of a group of people: 165cm, 170cm, 172cm, 174cm, 175cm, 176cm, 180cm, and 200cm. The outlier here is the height of 200cm, which is significantly higher than the other heights. If we calculate the mean, it will be affected by this outlier and will be higher than the expected value. On the other hand, the median will not be affected and will be equal to 175cm, which is a better representation of the central tendency of the dataset in the presence of an outlier. Similarly, the range and standard deviation will also be affected by the outlier and will give a higher value than expected."
