    "Descriptive Statistics:\n",
    "Descriptive statistics are used to summarize and describe the main features of a dataset. This type of statistics is used to provide insights into the dataset, such as measures of central tendency, dispersion, and shape. Examples of descriptive statistics include mean, median, mode, range, variance, and standard deviation.\n",
    "Example: A study of 100 students’ grades in a class, where the researcher presents the mean, standard deviation, and frequency distribution of grades to get an overall understanding of how the students performed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inferential Statistics:\n",
    "Inferential statistics are used to draw conclusions about a population based on a sample. This type of statistics is used to make predictions, test hypotheses, and estimate parameters of a population based on the data collected from a sample. Examples of inferential statistics include t-tests, ANOVA, correlation, regression, and chi-square tests.\n",
    "Example: A pharmaceutical company wants to know whether a new drug reduces the symptoms of a particular disease. They conduct a clinical trial on a sample of patients and use inferential statistics to determine whether the observed effects in the sample can be generalized to the larger population of patients with the disease."

    "Ordinal Data:\n",

    "Example: Ranking the preferences of different types of ice cream flavors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interval Data:\n",
    "Interval data are numerical data that have equal intervals between values, but they do not have a true zero point. Interval data can be added, subtracted, and averaged, but they cannot be multiplied or divided. Examples of interval data include temperature and time.\n",
    "Example: Measuring temperature in degrees Celsius or Fahrenheit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ratio Data:\n",
    "Ratio data are numerical data that have a true zero point, where zero represents the complete absence of the variable being measured. Ratio data can be added, subtracted, multiplied, and divided, and they allow for meaningful ratios and percentages. Examples of ratio data include weight, height, and age.\n",

    "ANS- Understanding the level of measurement is important in data analysis because it determines the types of statistical analyses that can be performed on the data, as well as the appropriate visualizations and summary statistics. Using inappropriate statistical techniques can lead to incorrect conclusions, misinterpretation of data, and faulty predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, using the mean to summarize ordinal data or the mode to summarize interval data can be misleading because these summary statistics do not account for the order or magnitude of the data. Similarly, applying parametric tests to non-normal data can result in unreliable and inaccurate results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another example is when analyzing nominal data. The mode is the only appropriate summary statistic for nominal data, as there is no inherent order or numerical value to the categories. Any other summary statistics, such as the mean or median, would be meaningless.\n",

In nominal data, the categories or labels are used to differentiate the values. Nominal data cannot be arranged in any meaningful order or sequence.\n",

In ordinal data, the categories have a meaningful order or sequence, but the differences between the values cannot be measured."
